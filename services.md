## Our Advantage
>Canada applies a **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff rate** to aluminum coil imports from Taiwan. The MFN tariff rate for aluminum products, including aluminum coils, is typically **zero percent**, meaning these imports are duty-free under normal circumstances. This rate applies to countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and with whom Canada has no specific trade agreements altering this rate.â€‹
