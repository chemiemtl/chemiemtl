# Aluminum
Chemie Material Ltd. has over 15 years experience working with the largest aluminum manufacturing plant in Taiwan providing top quality aluminum coating coil / bare coil / food coil / NBPA coating coil for EOE/can body.

## Our Advantage
>Canada applies a **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff rate** to aluminum coil imports from Taiwan. The MFN tariff rate for aluminum products, including aluminum coils, is typically **zero percent**, meaning these imports are duty-free under normal circumstances. This rate applies to countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and with whom Canada has no specific trade agreements altering this rate.â€‹
